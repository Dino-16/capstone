## 🔧 Production .env Changes:

Make sure these are set correctly:
```env
MAIL_PORT=587                                    # was 465
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls                              # was ssl
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=olearenzemarkmendoza@gmail.com # REQUIRED!
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"                     # REQUIRED!
```

⚠️ IMPORTANT: MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS must be set!

## 💻 Commands to Run on Production ⚠️ CRITICAL:

```bash
php artisan config:clear  # MUST RUN THIS FIRST!
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Run `config:clear` after updating .env! 
Otherwise credentials won't be read properly!
